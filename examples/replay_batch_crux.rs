//! **The crux: time-travel reconstruction was O(N²); batching makes it O(N).**
//!
//! [`AgentSession::replay_to`](ccos::agent_session::AgentSession::replay_to) rebuilds the agent's
//! memory at any past step by re-applying the recorded op-log on top of the baseline — the engine
//! behind time-travel debugging, `recall_what_if`, and the counterfactual `retrieval_reward`. It
//! used to call the eager `ingest_source` for **every** `Ingest` op, so each of the N ingests re-ran
//! the three whole-graph resolve passes over an O(N) graph — **O(N²)** per reconstruction.
//!
//! B2-full made resolution **order-independent** (prune + rebuild from the final state), so the
//! replay can now *defer* every ingest and resolve **once** before each op that reads cross-file
//! edges (a recall page-in, a failure propagation) and once at the end — the byte-identical graph
//! (`replay == live` still holds, verified by `tests/replay_equivalence_property.rs`) at **O(N)**.
//!
//! This stages both reconstructions over a synthetic cross-referencing corpus and times them.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --release --example replay_batch_crux`
