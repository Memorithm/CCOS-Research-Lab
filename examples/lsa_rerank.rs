//! Does wiring LSA as a **re-ranking** stage in `recall` help? This is the follow-up
//! #39 called for: #39 showed LSA-rank16 is a better *dense ranker* than TF-IDF for
//! synonymy (recall@k≥5) but useless for entry selection (recall@1=0). So it belongs
//! at the ranking stage, not entry selection — which is exactly where
//! `set_lsa_rerank(Some(16))` puts it (it re-orders the recalled region, never the
//! entry).
//!
//! Setup: an `app` hub `use`s many topic modules (so a resolving query's region spans
//! them), with context files co-occurring each topic term with a synonym. We measure
//! the **mean rank** of each topic's target file in the window for a query that
//! resolves — re-ranking off vs on (lower is better) — and how many *pure synonym*
//! queries resolve at all, which is the honest limiter.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --release --example lsa_rerank`
