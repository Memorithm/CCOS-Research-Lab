//! **Does the centrality scoring term earn its keep?** `w_centrality` (off by
//! default) adds `w_centrality · ln(1 + resident_in_degree)` to a node's score, so a
//! structurally-central *hub* — a shared module many resident nodes depend on — is
//! retained even when it is not the most recently touched thing. This is the one
//! refinement Gemini's "prune by causal weight" analysis pointed at that CCOS had
//! **not yet measured**. Measure-first: build a realistic re-engagement workload under
//! paging pressure and see whether enabling centrality actually reduces page-faults on
//! the hubs — and at what cost to the leaves (a retained hub steals a resident slot).
//!
//! ## The workload (fully deterministic — nothing left to chance, no RNG)
//!
//! `R` regions, each a hub + `W` leaves that `DependsOn` it (so the hub's in-degree is
//! `W`). The agent works one region at a time, across `P` passes. Within a region it
//! sweeps a small **sliding window** over the leaves (width `WINDOW`, advancing by 1 so
//! windows overlap → leaves are revisited) and **re-consults the hub every `cadence`
//! leaf-accesses** (the shared module is needed again and again). The resident budget
//! is tight, so between two hub consults the fresh leaf accesses tend to evict the hub
//! — unless its structural centrality holds it in. An access to a cold node is a
//! **page-fault** ([`page_in`]); to a resident node, a **hit** ([`touch`], refreshing
//! recency/access exactly as a fault does, so the recency baseline is fair).
//!
//! The agent re-asserts the `leaf → hub` edge whenever both are resident (it re-observes
//! the dependency while working): under paging, demotion archives incident edges, so
//! this keeps the *resident* causal graph faithful to the true structure — and is
//! exactly the resident in-degree the centrality term scores on. We instrument that
//! in-degree to confirm the mechanism is genuinely engaged, not assumed.
//!
