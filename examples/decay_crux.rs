//! **Decay crux: why a stale, never-reaffirmed dissent should stop deadlocking a claim.** The
//! Q-Page "knowledge half-life". [`MemoryGraph::qbelief`] weighs every assertion equally and
//! forever, so a single old objection that was never revisited keeps a claim looking *eternally
//! contested* even after fresh evidence has arrived on the other side.
//! [`MemoryGraph::qbelief_decayed`] fades each edge by `0.5^(age / half_life)`, so a fresh
//! (re-)assertion outweighs an ageing one: recent evidence **resolves** the stale dissent, and the
//! agent's memory is not held hostage by a one-off objection it never reaffirmed.
//!
//! Fixture: a claim contested at `t = 0` (one support, one contradiction). The support is then
//! re-affirmed by a *fresh* assertion at time `T` while the contradiction is never revisited. We
//! sweep `T` and contrast the plain belief (frozen — a permanent deadlock) with the decayed belief
//! (the dissent fades, the claim resolves on its own).
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --release --example decay_crux`
