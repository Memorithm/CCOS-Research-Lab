//! **Propagation crux: belief revision across the causal graph.** A claim with *no evidence of its
//! own* should still take on a belief from the causes it depends on — if the database is (resolved
//! to be) the bottleneck, then "scaling the database cuts p99 latency" becomes more plausible even
//! before any direct evidence for it arrives. A static evidence store cannot do this: with no
//! incoming `Supports`/`Contradicts` edge a claim stays neutral forever.
//! [`MemoryGraph::propagate_beliefs`] runs one deterministic hop over the `Causes` edges: every
//! *resolved* cause (`|belief| ≥ threshold`) emits a derived, **attenuated** edge on its effect — a
//! `Supports` from a believed cause, a `Contradicts` from a refuted one — so the effect inherits a
//! weaker, correctly-signed belief. And because the signal attenuates below the threshold, the
//! wavefront naturally **stops** instead of cascading.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --release --example propagation_crux`
