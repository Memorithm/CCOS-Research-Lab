//! **Beating RAG on its own turf — semantic recall, deterministically.** Pure dense retrieval over
//! ccos's TF-IDF embedding *ties* a lexical RAG (it is the same signal — see `pure_retrieval_vs_rag`).
//! The win comes from the **encoder**: projecting TF-IDF through ccos's deterministic **LSA** latent
//! space (`LsaEncoder`) captures **synonymy** a literal-term retriever structurally cannot.
//!
//! The crux corpus is built so a query and its answer share **zero vocabulary** — a query uses one set
//! of words ("car vehicle drive"), its answer uses the synonyms ("automobile motor sedan") — and the
//! two are linked only by *bridge* documents where both vocabularies co-occur. A lexical retriever sees
//! no shared term and misses the answer; LSA learns "car ≈ automobile" from the bridges and retrieves
//! it. We measure the gap with the standard metrics — the numbers below are the REAL output of the run.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --release --example semantic_retrieval_crux`
