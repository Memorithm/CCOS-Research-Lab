//! **Conflict of Origins** — when two sources disagree about the *same* claim, a flat store has to
//! pick one, average them, or take the most recent. The Q-Page instead **nets them by authority**:
//! the more credible source sets the *direction* of `belief`, while `conflict` reports how contested
//! the claim still is and [`QBelief::is_validated`](ccos::memory::QBelief::is_validated) decides
//! whether it is safe to act on. This is the payoff of per-source authority weighting.
//!
//! Fixture: one claim, asserted **+** by a high-authority source A (official docs, authority 0.90)
//! and **−** by a source B (an incident report) whose authority `β` we sweep. The assertions are
//! produced through the [`Extractor`](ccos::extractor::Extractor) pipeline (a deterministic
//! [`MockExtractor`] here — the LLM-backed extractor produces the *same* shape from raw text) and
//! recorded via the normal `assert_support` / `assert_contradiction` path, so this is exactly what an
//! ingested document pair would yield.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --release --example conflict_of_origins`
