//! # External memory interface (`ExternalMemory` / [`CcosMemory`])
//!
//! A single, documented façade an agent uses to treat CCOS as its **external
//! working memory**: write code and failure signals in, recall a bounded,
//! causally-coherent context window out, and persist an auditable, hash-chained
//! state. It unifies the kernel's otherwise separate pieces — the causal
//! [`MemoryGraph`], the incremental parser ([`IncrementalGraphEngine`]), the
//! tamper-evident [`EventLog`]/[`DistributedEventLog`], the causal
//! [`query`] walks, and the [`ContextRegionEngine`] — behind one trait.
//!
//! ## The contract
//!
//! [`ExternalMemory`] is the stable surface; [`CcosMemory`] is the in-process
//! implementation. The operations are:
//!
//! | Operation | Meaning |
//! | --------- | ------- |
//! | [`ingest_source`](ExternalMemory::ingest_source) | write/update a file; the graph and the hash chain advance |
//! | [`signal_failure`](ExternalMemory::signal_failure) | mark a node as failing and propagate the pressure downstream |
//! | [`recall`](ExternalMemory::recall) | select a bounded context window ([`Recall`] strategy) |
//! | [`verify`](ExternalMemory::verify) | check the hash chain is intact (tamper-evidence) |
//! | [`stats`](ExternalMemory::stats) | counts (nodes/edges/events/files) |
//! | [`checkpoint`](ExternalMemory::checkpoint) | persist the whole state to the bound path |
//!
//! Plus inherent helpers on [`CcosMemory`]: [`open`](CcosMemory::open),
//! [`impact`](CcosMemory::impact)/[`causes`](CcosMemory::causes) (blast radius /
//! upstream causes), and [`tick`](CcosMemory::tick) (recency decay).
//!
//! ## Recall strategies
//!
//! - [`Recall::WorkingSet`] — the globally hottest nodes by causal score.
//! - [`Recall::Around`] — the causal **region** anchored on a node (the workspace
//!   signal: the active file / failing test), independent of any query text.
//! - [`Recall::Task`] — a free-text task: a lexical entry point, expanded to its
//!   region.
//! - [`Recall::Semantic`] — a free-text task resolved by **semantic** similarity
//!   (INT4 TF-IDF cosine over [`crate::embeddings`]), expanded to its region;
//!   falls back to the lexical entry below the embedding noise floor.
//! - [`Recall::Hybrid`] — a free-text task whose entry node is chosen by
//!   **reciprocal-rank fusion** of the lexical, semantic, and causal rankings,
//!   then expanded to its region. The most robust entry point.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use ccos::external_memory::{CcosMemory, ExternalMemory, Recall};
//!
//! let mut mem = CcosMemory::open("workspace.ccos").unwrap();
//! mem.ingest_source("src/db.rs", "pub fn query() {}\n");
//! mem.signal_failure("file:src/db.rs", 3).ok();
//! let window = mem.recall(&Recall::task("fix db timeout"), 2048);
//! for item in &window.items {
//!     println!("{:.3}  {}", item.score, item.uri);
//! }
//! assert!(mem.verify().valid);
//! mem.checkpoint().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Guarantees
//!
//! Deterministic recall (total order on `(score, uri)`); every `ingest_source`
//! extends a canonical SHA-256 hash chain, so [`verify`](ExternalMemory::verify)
//! detects any tampering with a persisted checkpoint; a checkpoint round-trips
//! (reload reproduces the graph and the chain).
