//! # Agent session — an event-sourced cognitive timeline (time-travel debugging)
//!
//! This is the capability that a RAG stack (LangGraph, LlamaIndex, …) structurally
//! lacks, and the one our measurements point CCOS toward: not *better retrieval*
//! (a lexical baseline matches that), but a **deterministic, replayable, auditable**
//! record of how an agent's working memory evolved.
//!
//! An [`AgentSession`] wraps a [`CcosMemory`] and records every cognitive operation
//! (ingest, failure signal, recall) as an ordered timeline. Because every operation
//! is deterministic, the state after the first `n` operations can be reconstructed
//! exactly with [`replay_to`](AgentSession::replay_to) — you can *rewind the agent's
//! mind*. And with [`recall_what_if`](AgentSession::recall_what_if) you can replay to
//! a point and re-run a recall under **different parameters** (e.g. a larger token
//! budget) to see whether the agent would have made a better decision — the
//! "time-travel debugger" for an LLM agent's context.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```
//! use ccos::agent_session::AgentSession;
//! use ccos::external_memory::{ExternalMemory, Recall};
//!
//! let mut s = AgentSession::new();
//! s.ingest("src/db.rs", "pub fn timeout() -> i64 { 30 }\n");
//! s.ingest("src/api.rs", "use crate::db;\npub fn handle() -> i64 { db::timeout() }\n");
//! s.signal_failure("file:src/api.rs", 3).ok();
//!
//! // A tight budget recalls a thin window…
//! let tight = s.recall(Recall::around("file:src/api.rs"), 30);
//! // …rewind to that step and replay with a larger budget — the what-if.
//! let roomy = s.recall_what_if(s.len() - 1, &Recall::around("file:src/api.rs"), 4000);
//! assert!(roomy.items.len() >= tight.items.len());
//!
//! // Replay reconstructs the exact state (determinism / auditability).
//! assert_eq!(s.replay_to(s.len()).stats().nodes, s.memory().stats().nodes);
//! ```
